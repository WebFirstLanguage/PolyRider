# 2025-06-16: CLI Implementation and Code Quality Improvements

## Changes Made

### CLI Component Implementation
- Implemented a cross-platform CLI tool called "logbie"
- Created core CLI classes:
  - `LogbieCLI\Application`: Main CLI application class for parsing arguments and dispatching commands
  - `LogbieCLI\CommandRegistry`: Registry for managing commands with support for both class-based and callback-based commands
  - `LogbieCLI\BaseCommand`: Abstract base class for all commands
  - `LogbieCLI\CommandInterface`: Interface defining the contract for all commands
  - `LogbieCLI\ConsoleLogger`: CLI-specific logger with colorized output
- Implemented built-in commands:
  - `BuildCommand`: For running composer install, creating directories, and compiling assets
  - `CleanCommand`: For removing vendor directory, generated assets, and cache files
  - `HelpCommand`: For displaying help information
  - `GenerateModuleCommand`: For creating new module skeletons with proper structure and PSR-4 compliance
- Added comprehensive documentation in `Docs/cli-tool-guide.md`
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Implemented robust error handling and logging

### Code Quality Improvements
- Integrated PHPStan for static analysis
- Fixed several code quality issues:
  - Resolved void return type issues in multiple files
  - Improved type safety in Container.php
  - Removed redundant conditions in CommandRegistry.php and CleanCommand.php
  - Added proper type checking for ReflectionType handling
- Updated phpstan.neon configuration with `treatPhpDocTypesAsCertain: false`
- Documented all fixes in phpstan-fixes.md

## Challenges and Solutions

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the CLI tool works consistently across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Solution**: Used PHP's built-in functions for file operations, avoided platform-specific commands, and implemented proper path handling with DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR

### Type Safety in Container.php
- **Challenge**: PHPStan identified issues with ReflectionType handling
- **Solution**: Added helper methods `canResolveClassDependency()` and `getClassNameFromType()` to properly handle different ReflectionType implementations

### Void Return Type Issues
- **Challenge**: Multiple instances of void methods being returned or their results being used
- **Solution**: Modified all instances to call the method and then use `return;` or `return null;` as appropriate

## Next Steps

1. **CLI Enhancement**:
   - Add more built-in commands for common tasks
   - Improve integration with the framework's container
   - Add support for command aliases
   - Enhance module generation with additional templates and customization options

2. **Static Analysis**:
   - Gradually increase PHPStan analysis level
   - Address any remaining code quality issues
   - Implement automated code quality checks in CI/CD

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update all documentation to reflect recent changes
   - Create more examples for custom command creation
   - Add tutorials for common CLI usage scenarios
