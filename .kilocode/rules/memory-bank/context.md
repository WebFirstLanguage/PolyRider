# Logbie Framework: Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The Logbie Framework is currently in development with a focus on establishing the core components and documentation. The framework aims to provide a comprehensive solution for PHP-based web application development with an emphasis on modularity, security, and maintainability.

## Recent Changes

- Initial documentation has been created for all major components
- Core architecture has been defined with clear namespace and directory structure guidelines
- PSR-4 compliance tools have been implemented (pathfinder.py and cc.py)
- Key components have been specified:
  - Module system
  - Database ORM
  - JavaScript framework (Logbie.js)
  - Template engine
  - Logging system
  - Response handling
  - User management

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation of Core Components**:
   - Complete the implementation of core classes based on the documentation
   - Develop unit tests for all components
   - Ensure PSR-4 compliance across the codebase

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Validate security measures
   - Benchmark performance

3. **Example Applications**:
   - Create sample applications demonstrating framework usage
   - Develop tutorials for common use cases
   - Provide starter templates

4. **Documentation Refinement**:
   - Expand API documentation
   - Create developer guides
   - Add more code examples

5. **Community Engagement**:
   - Establish contribution guidelines
   - Set up issue tracking
   - Create a roadmap for future development
