# Logbie Framework: Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The Logbie Framework is currently in development with a focus on establishing the core components, CLI tools, and code quality improvements. The framework aims to provide a comprehensive solution for PHP-based web application development with an emphasis on modularity, security, and maintainability.

## Recent Changes

- Initial documentation has been created for all major components
- Core architecture has been defined with clear namespace and directory structure guidelines
- PSR-4 compliance tools have been implemented (pathfinder.py and cc.py)
- Key components have been specified and implemented:
  - Module system
  - Database ORM
  - JavaScript framework (Logbie.js)
  - Template engine
  - Logging system
  - Response handling
  - User management
- **CLI Component**:
  - Implemented a cross-platform CLI tool called "logbie"
  - Created build and clean commands
  - Designed an extensible architecture for custom command creation
  - Added comprehensive documentation for CLI usage
  - Implemented robust error handling and cross-platform compatibility
  - Added support for both class-based and callback-based commands
- **Code Quality Improvements**:
  - Integrated PHPStan for static analysis
  - Fixed type safety issues and improved code quality
  - Added configuration for consistent code style
  - Resolved issues with void return types, type safety, and redundant conditions

## Next Steps

1. **Completion of Core Components**:
   - Finalize implementation of remaining core classes
   - Expand unit test coverage
   - Continue ensuring PSR-4 compliance across the codebase

2. **CLI Tool Enhancement**:
   - Add more built-in commands for common tasks
   - Improve cross-platform compatibility
   - Create additional documentation and examples

3. **Static Analysis Integration**:
   - Increase PHPStan analysis level gradually
   - Address any remaining code quality issues
   - Implement automated code quality checks in CI/CD

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Validate security measures
   - Benchmark performance

5. **Example Applications**:
   - Create sample applications demonstrating framework usage
   - Develop tutorials for common use cases
   - Provide starter templates

6. **Documentation Refinement**:
   - Expand API documentation
   - Create developer guides
   - Add more code examples

7. **Community Engagement**:
   - Establish contribution guidelines
   - Set up issue tracking
   - Create a roadmap for future development
